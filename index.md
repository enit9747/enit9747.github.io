## Welcome to Enit Studios
Enit Studios had its roots in hobbyist software programming and expanded to cover software reverse engineering, digital security research and development of anti-tamper solutions. We are not for hire, but we are currently working on our own honest projects.

Interested in consulting our portfolio and possibly seek business opportunities? You can contact us over e-mail and we'll be glad to hear you out!
